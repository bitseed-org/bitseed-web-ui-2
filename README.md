Bitseed Web UI for monitoring a Bitcoin Core (bitcoind) Node
===========================================================================================
     This is a fork of mpatterson99/phpBitAdmin-Bitcoin-HTML5-Wallet

This status panel is intended to allow easy monitoring of a bitcoin node on a remote server. When this code is installed on the node server, remote web browsers will be able to see the status of the connected node.

Bitseed is intended to be run purely as a full node and not as a wallet. This code does not provide adequate security for managing a wallet, so wallet transaction features are disabled.
